    				<h4>The New Royal - An overview</h4>

    				<p><span class="lead">For over 150 years we have been at the heart of Liverpool life and at the edge of pioneering healthcare.</span></p>

    				<p>Each year we care and treat around 172,000 emergency patients and day case admissions and see more than 490,000 patients in our outpatient department. </p>

    				<p>Our current building is out-dated. </p>

    				<p>Important facilities need constant maintenance and the layout of the hospital is inefficient. To refurbish our current hospital though would be extremely costly, lengthy and disruptive and still would not provide patients with the environment they deserve.</p>

    				<p>However, the vision for the new Royal is not a just a project to replace a crumbling and unloved building with a more modern and welcoming one. It is about creating a completely different kind of hospital at the heart of a radically renewed and improved local health service.</p>

    				<p>This vision is now becoming a reality. The new hospital will be built next to the current site on Prescot Street. Once it is constructed, our existing hospital will be demolished. In its place, there are plans to develop a world-class Liverpool BioCampus and health campus, as well as landscaping green space, roughly the size of Chavasse Park.</p>

    				<blockquote><p>Our new hospital will have:<br/>
    				664 beds, including a 40-bed Intensive Therapy Unit.<br/>
    				18 state-of-the-art theatres<br/>
    				23 wards and units, including a large clinical research facility.<br/>
    				The new hospital will provide every patient with a single bedroom with en-suite facilities. We believe that modern healthcare is as much about privacy, comfort and dignity as it is about pioneering treatments and cutting-edge technology.</p></blockquote>

    				<p>We will also have a comprehensive cancer centre on site working in collaboration with Clatterbridge comprehensive cancer centre, meaning that patients who live in Liverpool will have a world-class service closer to home.</p>

    				<p>The new Royal will be vital for the regeneration of Liverpool and transform an area which acts as a gateway into Liverpool. The construction of the new hospital will bring jobs and investment to the city. It is also crucial to the development of the city's Knowledge Quarter.</p>

    				<p>The new hospital will cost about &pound;335m, of which of the Trust, with assistance from the Department of Health, will contribute &pound;124m. The private sector will raise the remaining funding and it is expected that the European Investment Bank will make a significant contribution to this. The annual payment made to the Trust's private sector partner will be less than 6% of Trust income - one of the lowest in the NHS. The Trust is also investing &pound;94m in associated schemes including the multi storey car park, equipment and demolitions. </p>

    				<p>Construction is planned to start in 2014 and the new Royal is expected to open in 2017. As we are open to the public 24 hours a day, seven days a week, we will remain operational throughout the redevelopment.</p>

    				<p>The new Royal has a purpose and meaning. It's rooted in our values and ideals. It is something we believe in and are determined to deliver.</p>
