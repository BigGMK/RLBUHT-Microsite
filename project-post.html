                    <!--Post content, HTML text format--><strong>A man with a vision</strong>
                    <p class="lead">Tim Kelsey has a reputation as a visionary in the NHS. A man who has dedicated his professional life to the sharing of information, Kelsey has certainly been making his mark on the health service.</p>

                    <p>Since taking on the mantle of NHS England's national director for patients and information back in 2012, he has set about bringing technology and data to the fore, with the aim of radically transforming how health services are delivered.</p>

                    <p>"This is no less than an industrial revolution we are witnessing," he says. "Industrial revolutions are about the way in which man, through ingenuity and enterprise, scales new heights of knowledge. We are entering a period of human history where we are about to experience an extraordinary and profound knowledge revolution, particularly focussed on the kinds of data that are about us."</p>

                    <p>The fact that the health service is now moving into this era is crucial. Kelsey tells Highland Marketing that the NHS is now starting to gain a foothold on the exponential curve of the data and technology revolution. And with an impending 2018 deadline for a paperless NHS and an even closer deadline looming for patient access to information by 2015, big strides are already being taken to accelerate change.</p>

                    <div><strong>Unprecedented electronic interoperability - preconditions for a sustainable NHS</strong></div>
                    <p>"We have made genuinely remarkable progress," says Kelsey. "We have made a very significant start. In some ways the most important long-term precondition for the sustainability of health service is the work we have been doing on promoting interoperability.</p>

                    <blockquote>"Currently we rely on paper based records, which can get lost, which can be inaccurate or duplicated. These things are administratively insensible and costly and are also potentially very dangerous for patients. They don't promote any proper integration for the patients' journey through their healthcare," he explains.</blockquote>

                    <p>Work on developing electronic records and enabling information to flow freely between different doctors and clinicians, so they can improve the quality of patient care, has been central to changing this, Kelsey says.</p>

                    <p>The Safer Wards, Safer Hospitals Technology Fund, which has seen an injection of &pound;250m from the Department of Health, matched by a similar amount from the health service, has been driving forward electronic record keeping in trusts. "This is an unprecedented incentive to really get a focus from the frontline as a top priority," he says.</p>

                    <p>And much more besides is being achieved.</p>

                    <blockquote>"We are looking at major programmes of work being prioritised by the Prime Minister, the success of which is determined by collaboration with industry," he adds. "A key example is genomics and life sciences.<br/><br/>

                    "We have published large amounts of data on general practice. This has broadened out access to useful information on local services. In addition we have published, for the first time anywhere in the world, information on surgeon outcomes.<br/><br/>

                    "On the participation side we have launched a series of initiatives which will be genuinely transformative for the patients and citizens. GPs will have to offer online services to their patients."</blockquote>

                    <div><strong>Liberating the power of people</strong></div>
                    <p>These formative changes that will, for example, allow patients to book appointments online, order their repeat prescriptions online and access their medical information over the internet, are all long overdue, he adds, especially when compared to how the internet is already reaching other parts of everyday life.</p>

                    <p>But they are crucial when it comes to changing how healthcare is delivered. "The idea that we want to leverage the power of the data that is generated in and around the patient and citizen as they interact with their care is fundamental," says Kelsey.</p>

                    <p>"We can't properly improve care unless we are able to understand at what standard the outcome is delivered. From a purely clinical and patient perspective we need to use every data resource we have to ensure that the health and care system as a whole delivers high quality care for all."</p>

                    <p>This data is also key to liberating the power of people, he adds. "A very important component of the future our health and care system is that we as citizens take on more responsibility for our wellbeing and take on more responsibility for managing our care for ourselves.</p>

                    <p>"We can't do that and the tools to manage those opportunities can't be developed without the data about us and our behaviours in healthcare being available."</p>
